# Week 5 Assignment: Risk Modelling and Portfolio Optimization using Python

## Objective
Quantify and optimize financial portfolio risk using Modern Portfolio Theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and advanced risk metrics. Build a comprehensive portfolio optimization tool that demonstrates mastery of risk-return trade-offs in finance.

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing (10 points)

**Requirements:**
1. Load historical price data for your selected assets
2. Calculate daily returns and handle missing values
3. Create summary statistics table showing:
   - Mean annual returns
   - Annual volatilities  
   - Sharpe ratios (assume 2% risk-free rate)
   - Maximum drawdowns
4. Generate correlation matrix and heatmap
5. Provide data quality assessment

**Requirements:**
1. Implement Monte Carlo simulation to generate â‰¥10,000 random portfolios
2. For each portfolio, calculate:
   - Expected return
   - Volatility (risk)
   - Sharpe ratio
3. Create efficient frontier visualization

   - Monte Carlo results
   - Analytical optimization (scipy.optimize)
2. Compare both methods and discuss differences
3. Display optimal portfolio characteristics:
   - Asset weights and allocations
   - Expected return and volatility
   - Sharpe ratio
4. Create portfolio weights visualization (pie chart or bar chart)
5. Calculate portfolio beta (if using market index as benchmark)

**Deliverables:**
- Optimization implementation (both methods)
- Optimal portfolio summary table
- Portfolio weights visualization
- Method comparison analysis

---

### Task 4: Risk Metrics Calculation (20 points)

**Requirements:**

   - Historical simulation method
   - Parametric method (normal distribution)
   - Monte Carlo simulation method
2. Compare results across methods
3. Create return distribution visualization with VaR/CVaR markers
4. Calculate additional risk metrics:

   - Efficient frontier with highlighted optimal portfolios
   - Portfolio weights breakdown
   - Risk-return scatter plot for individual assets
   - VaR/CVaR distribution analysis
   - Correlation heatmap
2. Professional styling and clear labels
3. Interpret key findings and insights
4. Discuss diversification benefits observed
5. Compare optimal portfolio vs equal-weighted portfolio

**Deliverables:**
- Multi-panel visualization dashboard
- Written interpretation (1-2 pages)
- Key insights and recommendations
- Discussion of limitations and assumptions

---

## Bonus Challenge ðŸ’¡ (10 extra points)

Implement advanced portfolio optimization features:

1. **Risk-Free Asset Integration**: Add a risk-free asset and compute the Capital Allocation Line
2. **Constrained Optimization**: Implement portfolio optimization with constraints:
   - No short selling (weights â‰¥ 0)
   - Maximum weight per asset (â‰¤ 40%)
   - Minimum weight per asset (â‰¥ 5%)
3. **CAPM Analysis**: Calculate alpha and beta for each asset and the optimal portfolio
4. **Backtesting**: Implement simple backtesting to evaluate portfolio performance over time
