# Week 2 Challenge: Volatility Regime Detection ðŸŽ¯

## Overview

Welcome to an advanced challenge that bridges feature engineering with regime-switching models! You'll build a sophisticated volatility regime detection system that can identify different market conditions and their persistence patterns.

**Why This Matters:** 
- Volatility clustering is a fundamental property of financial markets
- Different regimes require different trading strategies
- Regime detection is crucial for risk management and portfolio optimization

---

## Challenge Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will:

1. **Master Advanced Volatility Measures** - Implement multiple volatility calculation methods
2. **Build Regime Detection Systems** - Create algorithms to identify market states
3. **Analyze Regime Persistence** - Study how long different regimes typically last
4. **Apply Statistical Methods** - Use quantile-based classification and transition analysis
5. **Create Professional Visualizations** - Build comprehensive regime analysis dashboards

---

## Dataset Requirements

**Primary Data**: Use **NIFTY 50** index data for the past **3 years**
- Symbol: `^NSEI` (Yahoo Finance)
- Period: 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01
- Frequency: Daily

**Backup**: If NIFTY data is unavailable, use S&P 500 (`^GSPC`) or generate synthetic data using provided functions.
