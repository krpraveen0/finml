# Week 4 Challenge: Hybrid Financial Forecasting using ARIMA + LSTM Ensemble

## Overview

This advanced challenge explores **hybrid forecasting models** that combine the strengths of statistical and machine learning approaches. You'll build an ensemble that leverages ARIMA's linear pattern recognition with LSTM's non-linear modeling capabilities.

**Why Hybrid Models Matter:**
- ARIMA captures linear trends and autocorrelations
- LSTM handles complex non-linear patterns
- Ensemble methods often outperform individual models
- Real-world financial data contains both linear and non-linear components

---

## Challenge Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will:
1. **Build Individual Models**: Implement both ARIMA and LSTM forecasters
2. **Create Hybrid Architecture**: Combine models using residual analysis
3. **Perform Rolling Validation**: Test models using walk-forward methodology
4. **Analyze Performance**: Compare standalone vs ensemble approaches
5. **Visualize Results**: Create comprehensive comparison dashboards

---

## Dataset Requirements

**Primary Data**: Use **S&P 500 (^GSPC)** or **NIFTY 50 (^NSEI)** index
- **Period**: 2019-01-01 to 2025-01-01 (6 years)
- **Frequency**: Daily closing prices
- **Target**: Daily returns or log returns

**Backup**: If market data unavailable, use provided synthetic time series
