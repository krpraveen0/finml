- Create lag features for time series financial data

## What is Financial Modelling?

Financial modelling is the process of creating mathematical representations of financial situations, instruments, or markets to understand, predict, and make decisions about financial outcomes. Traditional financial models rely on economic theories, statistical relationships, and domain expertise.

In the context of machine learning, financial modelling extends these concepts by leveraging algorithms that can automatically discover patterns in data, handle complex non-linear relationships, and adapt to changing market conditions.

## Why Machine Learning in Finance?

Machine learning brings several advantages to financial modelling:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: ML algorithms excel at finding complex patterns in large datasets that humans might miss
2. **Adaptability**: Models can continuously learn and adapt to new market conditions
3. **Speed**: Automated processing of vast amounts of financial data in real-time
4. **Non-linear Relationships**: Capture complex interactions between financial variables
5. **Risk Management**: Improve risk assessment and portfolio optimization through better predictions

## Types of Financial Data

Financial data comes in various forms, each with unique characteristics:

- **Time Series Data**: Stock prices, trading volumes, economic indicators (sequential, temporal dependencies)
- **Cross-sectional Data**: Company fundamentals, balance sheet information (snapshot at specific time)
- **Panel Data**: Combination of time series and cross-sectional (multiple entities over time)
- **Alternative Data**: News sentiment, satellite imagery, social media (unstructured, high-dimensional)
- **High-frequency Data**: Tick-by-tick trading data (very granular, noise-prone)

## The ML Pipeline

The machine learning pipeline in finance typically follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical financial data from various sources
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful predictive variables from raw data
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms based on the problem type
5. **Training & Validation**: Train models and validate performance on unseen data
6. **Deployment**: Implement models in production trading or risk systems
7. **Monitoring**: Continuously evaluate model performance and retrain as needed

## Key ML Concepts

**Feature**: An individual measurable property of observed phenomena (e.g., stock price, volume, moving average)

**Label**: The target variable we want to predict (e.g., next day's return, default probability)

**Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, leading to poor performance on new data. This is particularly dangerous in finance where patterns may be temporary.

## Common Algorithms in Finance

| Algorithm | Use Case | Advantages | Limitations |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Linear Regression | Return prediction, factor analysis | Interpretable, fast | Assumes linear relationships |
| Random Forest | Feature selection, non-linear patterns | Handles interactions well | Less interpretable |
| LSTM Networks | Time series forecasting | Captures long-term dependencies | Requires large datasets |
| SVM | Classification, regime detection | Works well with small datasets | Sensitive to feature scaling |
| K-Means | Portfolio clustering, risk grouping | Simple, unsupervised | Requires choosing number of clusters |

## Financial ML Workflow

Our typical workflow for this bootcamp will be:

1. **Load Financial Data**: Use APIs like yfinance or prepared datasets
2. **Engineer Features**: Create lag variables, technical indicators, and rolling statistics
3. **Split Data Chronologically**: Respect time order (no look-ahead bias)
4. **Train Model**: Fit algorithm on historical data
5. **Evaluate Performance**: Use financial metrics (MSE, R², Sharpe ratio)
6. **Visualize Results**: Plot predictions vs actual, residual analysis
7. **Iterate**: Refine features and model based on results

## Linear Regression Example

Linear regression is often the starting point for financial ML models. For predicting stock returns, we can use lagged returns as features:

**Model Equation:**
```
Return(t) = β₀ + β₁×Return(t-1) + β₂×Return(t-2) + β₃×Return(t-3) + β₄×Return(t-4) + β₅×Return(t-5) + ε
```

Where:
- `Return(t)` is today's return (target variable)
- `Return(t-1)` through `Return(t-5)` are the previous 5 days' returns (features)
- `β₀, β₁, ..., β₅` are model coefficients to be learned
- `ε` is the error term

This model assumes that today's return can be partially predicted by recent historical returns, capturing momentum or mean-reversion patterns in the market.

## Evaluation Metrics

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared differences between predicted and actual values
```
MSE = (1/n) × Σ(actual - predicted)²
```
Lower MSE indicates better model performance.

**R-squared (R²)**: Proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model
```
R² = 1 - (SSres / SStot)
```
Values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better explanatory power.
